# A Docusaurus Plugin For Managing Release Artifacts

Many things need to happen when we release things, and this usually starts 
at whatever system is managing the tasks and tickets that are going into
the release. 

This plugin hopes to simplify pulling from popular task management systems
like Jira, Notion, Trello, Github, Gitlab and others to handle tasks that
can be automated like:

 - Flipping config bits
 - Generating blog post drafts 
 - Adding or updating documentation atomically (with or without versioning in use)
 - Other things robots can do for us
